# Data Structures

## General

* What data structures best allows me to solve the problem (with the best space-time complexity)

## Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity measures how fast an algorithm runs
* Space complexity measures how much memory an algorithm takes up

## Memory

* Any piece of data can be transformed into binary numbers
* Data is stored in blocks of bytes (8 bits) within a bounded array of memory slots
* Memory slots can be accessed via memory addresses
* If data to be stored takes up more than 1 byte, it is stored in several adjacent blocks of memory 
* Integers are usually fixed-width, meaning that despite their value they take up the same memory
* Strings can be mapped to numbers via ASCII code
* One can also store references (pointers) to other memory slots within a slot
